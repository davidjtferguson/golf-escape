fiddling with gravity, need to make ball weighty with making x and y movement feel natural

Immediate drop off of force, or increasing drop off over time?
Other ways to play with force management?

play test using -> for clockwise and <- for anticlockwise
- will it become confusing when line is pointing down?

next todo:
- collision re-write tweaks
-> issue where being on the ground triggers left and right side collision
->> patched by only checking top when in air, but that's not satisfying since it means treadmills can't go against walls.
->> find more robust solution.
-> issues when colliding with an edge at high speeds.
-> reduce speed to prevent escaping. speed scale will probably end up way smaller.
-> convayer belt should interface with xvel, not x directly

- hooks tweaks
-> allign visual and hitcircles
-> tweak hitcircles size to be natural feeling
-> smooth transition when hitting hook

- death/reset
-> checkpoint system
-> spikes/kill tiles

other todo:
- different ground tiles
-> bunker (current stop)
-> bounce to a stop

- hooks
-> consider visuals
->> helecopter blade?
->> bob up and down to show flying?
-> flying hooks that move after attaching to them

- decide on AV size. Should be a lot smaller, and should be round

- refine prediction path
-> seems to be off height wise
-> needs to hit edges exactly where the AV would (should be based on AV size so we can change sizes easily)
-> decide how it should look

- rotate AV while moving through air

- visual change on AV while aiming and charging aim
