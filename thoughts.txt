fiddling with gravity, need to make ball weighty with making x and y movement feel natural

Immediate drop off of force, or increasing drop off over time?
Other ways to play with force management?

play test using -> for clockwise and <- for anticlockwise
- will it become confusing when line is pointing down?

next todo:
- collision re-write tweaks
-> can trigger different side collisions. Need another mechanic against this:
->> fake bigger box to verify which side is coliding
->> do an 'all collision' first and do something special for that
-> test predict - think it's working but test
-> move out of wall functions need to check any collision, not all collision.
->> re-instate for left side. fix for all sides :)

- death/reset
-> checkpoint system
-> spikes/kill tiles

other todo:
- different ground tiles
-> bunker (current stop)
-> bounce to a stop

- decide on AV size. Should be a lot smaller, and should be round

- refine prediction path
-> seems to be off height wise
-> needs to hit edges exactly where the AV would (should be based on AV size so we can change sizes easily)
-> decide how it should look

- rotate AV while moving through air

- visual change on AV while aiming and charging aim
